# Haxball Player Ranking

functionality for locally ranking players in the Haxball client.

## Features

- Cross Rooms: Identifies each user by its name, giving you the
  ability to rank a player, and seeing his rank in different rooms automatically

- Three ranks for a player: Bad, Average, Good

- Local storage for data

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: https://github.com/oghb/haxball-client.

2. Replace the content.js file in the folder with my content.js (located at: resources\app\Haxball-Room-Extension\js).

## Usage

1. Rank a player by clicking on the icon next to his name.

2. The ranks are cycled, so click on the bad rank icon to rank the player, and then click on the good rank icon to change the player rank.
